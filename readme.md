This was my very first attempt at creating a game and creating custom artwork.

TurnUp was originally created using the Cocos2D game engine. Cocos2D is no longer supported, so this version was made using Unity. 

The idea for TurnUp came from a midnight brainstorm session. I thought about what mechanics would result in a fairly simple yet action-packed game: few controls with constant small objectives to accomplish. Thus, TurnUp was born.

Because this was a solo project, I tried keep the complexity of the game to a minimum. However, I still faced many obstacles, such as:

-	implementing touch controls (later versions of Unity make this simpler)
-	fine tuning the difficulty of the game to make it challenging yet appeal to a large audience
-	designing simple yet effective UI elements

The result is a fairly simple game that keeps players coming back to overcome new challenges.

Clone the executable folder which contains executables for Windows & Mac.

Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to run this app on iOS without jumping through many hoops (acquiring certificates, etc.).
